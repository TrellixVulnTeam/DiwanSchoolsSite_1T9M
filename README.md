# 82305
This is where I am backing up my code for CMU's class, 82305 - French in its Social Contexts.
For my project, I wanted to explore the education system in France while learning how to create my own website,
something that I had never done before. I am currently using Heroku to host my site with the help of Django framework -
it is currently rather slow with all my photos and videos, but it's free!

During my sophmore spring semester, eight other class
members and I went to Nantes, France for our spring break to collect materials for our projects,
as well as to learn more about French culture (it was my first time there!).
I chose my project to be on [Diwan immersion schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwan_(school)).
While I was in France, I went to an elementary school and a middle school and interviewed the principals there,
as well as some other staff members at the school. So please check out
[my site](https://diwan82305.herokuapp.com/static/pages/main.html)
to see the interviews, some pictures, and some of my research along the way. The purpose of the site is
to give an introduction to the Diwan school concept, as well to give insight on how bilingualism affects education and
culture. Please note that
I am still making some changes to the website, as my web development skills improve, as well as
working towards transferring it to a faster server when I have the time.
