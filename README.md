# About
This repository is for the site I built as a project for a
french class at Carnegie Mellon University, French in its Social Contexts (82-305).
For my project, I wanted to learn how to create a website,
which I had never done before. I am currently using Heroku's services to host my site -
it is currently rather slow, but it's free!

I took the class during my sophomore spring. The goal of the class to create an interactive
project to help others learn more about French language and culture.
We were lucky enough to go to Nantes during our spring break to gather materials for our projects.
I chose my project to be on [Diwan immersion schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwan_(school)).
while i was in france, i went to an elementary school and a middle school and interviewed the principals there,
as well as some other staff members. So please check out
[my site](https://diwan82305.herokuapp.com/static/pages/main.html)
to see my interviews, photographs, and some of my research along the way.
