# 82305
This is where I am backing up some of my code for CMU's class, 82305 - French in its Social Contexts.
For my project, I wanted to learn how to create my own website,
something that I had never done before. I am currently using Heroku to host my site -
it is currently rather slow, but it's free!

During my sophmore spring semester, eight other class
members and I went to Nantes, France for our spring break to collect data for our projects,
as well as to learn more about French culture (it was my first time there).
I chose my project to be on [Diwan immersion schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwan_(school)).
While I was in France, I went to an elementary school and a middle school and interviewed the principals there,
as well as some other staff on the school. So please check out
[my site](https://diwan82305.herokuapp.com/static/pages/main.html)
to see the interviews, some pictures, and some of my research along the way. Please note that
I am still making some changes to the website, as my web skills improve, as well as
working towards transferring it to a faster server when I have the time.
